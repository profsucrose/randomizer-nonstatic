# Randomizer Static

## Develop

To start, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

After that, it's pretty simple to get started:

- Install dependencies (and dev dependencies) using `npm install --save-dev`
- Run `npm start` to start the development server

## Deploy

If you don't already have a hosting platform in mind, I'd recommend [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It's fast and convenient, and it's free for non-commercial/hobby use. All you'll need to do is connect to your GitHub account and select this repository to deploy.

If you prefer another hosting platform, you will need to create a production build of this code by running `npm run build` in your terminal. Once you have done so, the `build` folder will be populated with a production build of this code, which you can host anywhere that supports static files.
